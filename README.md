# Project exam 2

## Description

This application is as a web-based product that gives users the ability to become either a customer, or a venue manager(vm). Customers may browse and search for venues and click for more detailed description, then book the respective venue clicked, while vm's may create a venue in which other customers may book. Customers may see which venues(s) they have booked with date-details, while vm's may see which of their venues are booked in date-details. Vm's also has the ability to edit their venue(s) details.

## Frameworks, tools and plugins

### React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. We'll get to the funny XML-like tags soon. We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen.

### Material UI

Material UI (MUI) is a open-source React library that provides pre-built, customizable components based on Google's Material Design. It helps developers create modern, responsive, and visually appealing web applications with ease, offering flexibility through theming and customization while being production-ready out of the box.

### DayJs

Day.js is a lightweight JavaScript library for parsing, validating, and formatting dates. It provides a simple API similar to Moment.js but with a much smaller size, making it ideal for modern web applications that prioritize performance.
